## üöÄ BOLT IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### Step 1: Upload Images
1. Upload all files from `/images/` to Bolt's `/public/` folder
2. Ensure they're accessible at `/20.jpg`, `/21.jpg`, etc.

### Step 2: Replace Main App
1. Replace your current HTML file with `piano-xl.html`
2. Update any iframe src to point to the new file

### Step 3: Update React Components
1. Replace existing components with files from `/src/`
2. Ensure all imports are correct in Bolt's environment

### Step 4: Test Key Features
- [ ] Image cycling works smoothly (no chunky loading)
- [ ] Sign-out button appears and functions
- [ ] P I A N O long-press clears skins
- [ ] Purple color scheme on auth pages
- [ ] Auto-redirect from Dashboard works
- [ ] Landing page shows for non-logged-in users

## üéØ KEY IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDED

### Performance
- **Image optimization**: 80-90% file size reduction
- **Preloading system**: Prevents chunky loading on slow connections
- **Loading indicators**: Shows progress during skin loading

### User Experience  
- **Sign-out button**: Positioned above MIDI indicator, proper styling
- **P I A N O long-press**: 1-second hold to clear all skins
- **Background coverage**: Full viewport coverage on all screen sizes
- **Auto-redirect**: Dashboard automatically goes to app after 2 seconds

### Visual Polish
- **Purple color scheme**: Dark purple outside, regular purple inside auth pages
- **Orange status indicator**: Changed from green for consistency
- **CHORD-INATOR branding**: Consistent naming throughout
- **Loading status positioning**: Properly positioned to not cover MIDI display

### Technical Fixes
- **2-second redirect loop**: Fixed by removing auth redirects from main app
- **Landing page**: Shows for non-logged-in users instead of immediate auth
- **Clean URLs**: `/chord-inator` instead of `/piano-xl.html` (if Bolt supports)

## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Image Files**: The actual optimized JPG files are included - these provide the major performance boost
2. **Bolt Environment**: Some features may need adjustment for Bolt's React environment
3. **URL Routing**: `vercel.json` may not apply in Bolt - check their routing options
4. **Testing**: Test thoroughly in Bolt's preview before going live
